Comment: One commenter expressed the belief that CMS does not have authority and discretion to require price transparency disclosure, including negotiated rates. Hospitals and patient advocates alike indicated that hospital standard charges fail to provide patients with individualized cost of care information, such as an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket costs or \u2018guaranteed, real prices in dollars.\u2019 One commenter requested that CMS require hospitals to make public their standard charges \u201cin dollars and cents\u201d and asserted that anything less would \u201cviolate the intent of the regulation.\u201d Hospital commenters expressed concern that display of hospital standard charges serves only to lead to scrutiny of hospital operations and have generated \u201cunfounded ire\u201d and been used as \u201ca sounding board for special interest groups\u201d and allowed third-party payers to \u201clowball payment proposals,\u201d thereby harming competition. One hospital commenter observed that, instead of providing directly actionable information to.Page 1370.patients, the current requirements are more useful for academic studies, health care finance professionals and insurance companies, which use the data to compare rates among peers. Response: The HPT regulation implements sections 2718(b)(3) and (e) of the PHS Act and represents a significant first step toward increasing competition through transparency of hospital standard charges. As we stated in the CY 2020 HPT final rule, we believe there is a direct connection between transparency in hospital standard charge information and having more affordable healthcare and lower healthcare coverage costs. We believe healthcare markets could work more efficiently and provide consumers with higher-value healthcare if we promote policies that encourage choice and competition. As we have stated on numerous occasions, we believe that transparency in healthcare pricing is critical to enabling patients to become active consumers so that they can lead the drive towards value. (84 FR 65526) As we stated in the CY 2020 HPT final rule, we continue to encourage hospitals to provide consumers with cost information in a consumer-friendly manner. To be clear, as upheld by the courts, we have authority to require hospitals to disclose payer-specific negotiated charges. We continue to believe that disclosure of hospital standard charges, including payer-specific negotiated charges, is critical for driving competition and are pleased that the intended users of this information, including payers, 761 researchers, 762 providers, 761 Pierce, S.

As we explained in the CY 2020 HPT final rule, each of the standard charges were chosen specifically because they are relevant to a specific group of consumers, including the rate negotiated between a hospital and third-party payer which is a critical component for determining an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket obligations. Thus, we finalized a requirement for hospitals to disclose the rate they have negotiated with third party payers (a standard charge called the \u2018payer-specific negotiated charge\u2019 defined at 45 CFR 180.20). As explained in more detail in XVIII.B Page 16.C. Detailed Economic Analyses D. Regulatory Review Cost Estimation E. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) Analysis F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Analysis G. Federalism H. Conclusion I. Congressional Review I. Summary and Background A. Executive Summary of this Document 1. Purpose In this final rule with comment period, we are updating the payment policies and payment rates for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), beginning January 1, 2024. Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to annually review and update the payment rates for services payable under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). Specifically, section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to review certain components of the OPPS not less often than annually, and to revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments that take into account changes in medical practice, changes in technology, and the addition of new services, new cost data, and other relevant information and factors. In addition, under section 1833(i)(D)(v) of the Act, we annually review and update the ASC payment rates. This final rule with comment period also includes additional policy changes made in accordance with our experience with the OPPS and the ASC payment system and recent changes in our statutory authority. We describe these and various other statutory authorities in the relevant sections of this final rule with comment period. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR).Page 17.Program, the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program, and Rural Emergency Hospital Quality Reporting (REHQR) Program. In addition, this final rule with comment period establishes payment for intensive outpatient services under Medicare, beginning January 1, 2024. This final rule with comment period also updates and refines the requirements for hospitals to make public their standard charges and CMS enforcement of hospital price transparency regulations. In addition, we are finalizing changes to the CMHC CoPs to provide requirements for furnishing IOP services. In addition, we are finalizing changes to the CMHC CoPs to provide requirements for furnishing IOP services, as well as finalizing the proposed personnel qualifications for MHCs and MFTs. We are also finalizing the removal of discussion of the IPPS Medicare Code Editor (MCE) from the annual IPPS rulemakings, beginning with the FY 2025 rulemaking. Finally, we are finalizing a technical correction to the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) CoPs under the standard for the designation and certification of REHs. 2. Summary of the Major Provisions \u25cf OPPS Update: For 2024, we are increasing the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor of 3.1 percent. This increase factor is based on the final inpatient hospital market basket percentage increase of 3.3 percent for inpatient services paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) reduced by a final productivity adjustment of 0 Page 1462.be in compliance with some of these new requirements, and we will begin enforcing hospital compliance with those new requirements on the applicable later compliance date. The date by which hospitals must comply with each of the new requirements in section XVIII.B of this final rule with comment period are described in Tables 151A and 151B. Table 151A describes the implementation timeline for adoption of a CMS template layout and encoding of the required data elements.

In addition, we are finalizing changes to the CMHC CoPs to provide requirements for furnishing IOP services. In addition, we are finalizing changes to the CMHC CoPs to provide requirements for furnishing IOP services, as well as finalizing the proposed personnel qualifications for MHCs and MFTs.

Finally, we are finalizing a technical correction to the Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) CoPs under the standard for the designation and certification of REHs. 2. Summary of the Major Provisions \u25cf OPPS Update: For 2024, we are increasing the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department (OPD) fee schedule increase factor of 3.1 percent. This increase factor is based on the final inpatient hospital market basket percentage increase of 3.3 percent for inpatient services paid under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) reduced by a final productivity adjustment of 0.2 percentage point. Based on this update, we estimate that total payments to OPPS providers (including beneficiary cost sharing and estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case mix) for calendar year (CY) 2024 will be approximately $88.9 billion, an increase of approximately $6.0 billion compared to estimated CY 2023 OPPS payments. We are continuing to implement the statutory 2.0 percentage point reduction in payments for hospitals that fail to meet the hospital outpatient quality reporting requirements by applying a reporting factor of 0.9806 to the OPPS payments and copayments for all applicable services..Page 18.\u25cf Data used in CY 2024 OPPS/ASC Ratesetting: To set OPPS and ASC payment rates, we normally use the most updated claims and cost report data available. The best available claims data is the most recent set of data which would be from 2 years prior to the calendar year that is the subject of rulemaking. Cost report data usually lags the claims data by a year and we believe that using the most updated cost report extract available from the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) is appropriate for CY 2024 OPPS ratesetting. Therefore, we are using our typical data process of using the most updated cost reports and claims data available for CY 2024 OPPS ratesetting. \u25cf Partial Hospitalization Update: For CY 2024, we are finalizing changes to our methodology used to calculate the Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) and hospital-based PHP (HB PHP) geometric mean per diem costs. We also are finalizing changes to expand PHP payment from two APCs to four APCs. \u25cf Medicare Payment for Intensive Outpatient Programs: Beginning in CY 2024, we are finalizing payment for intensive outpatient program (IOP) services under Medicare. We are finalizing the scope of benefits, physician certification requirements, coding and billing, and payment rates under the IOP benefit. IOP services may be furnished in hospital outpatient departments, community mental health centers (CMHCs), federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), and rural health clinics (RHCs). We also are finalizing payment for intensive outpatient services provided by opioid treatment programs (OTPs) under the existing OTP benefit. \u25cf Changes to the Inpatient Only (IPO) List: For 2024, we are finalizing our proposal to not remove any services from the IPO list for CY 2024. \u25cf 340B-Acquired Drugs: For CY 2024, we are continuing to apply the default rate, generally average sales price (ASP) plus 6 percent, to 340B acquired drugs and biologicals in this final rule with comment period  Summary of Final Policies In this final rule with comment period, we are finalizing our proposals to revise several of our HPT requirements in order to improve our monitoring and enforcement capabilities by improving access to, and the usability of, hospital standard charge information; reducing the compliance burden on hospitals by providing CMS templates and technical guidance for display of hospital standard charge information; aligning, where feasible, certain HPT requirements and processes with requirements and processes we have implemented in the TIC initiative; and making other modifications to our monitoring and enforcement capabilities that will, among.Page 1376.other things, increase its transparency to the public. Specifically, we are finalizing: (1) definitions of several terms; (2) a requirement that hospitals make a good faith effort to ensure standard charge information is true, accurate, and complete, and to include a statement affirming this in the MRF; (3) new data elements that hospitals must include in their MRFs, as well a requirement that hospitals encode standard charge information in a CMS template layout; (4) a phased implementation timeline applicable to the new requirements we are finalizing in this final rule with comment period; (5) a requirement that hospitals to include a .txt file in the root folder that includes a direct link to the MRF and a link in the footer on its website that links directly to the publicly available webpage that hosts the link to the MRF; and (6) improvements to our enforcement process by updating our methods to assess hospital compliance, requiring hospitals to acknowledge receipt of warning notices, working with health system officials to address noncompliance issues in one or more hospitals that are part of a health system, and publicizing more information about CMS enforcement activities related to individual hospital compliance. Specifically, and as discussed in more detail below, we are finalizing that the effective date of the changes to the hospital price transparency regulations at 45 CFR part 180 will be January 1, 2024. However, the regulation text will specify later dates by which hospitals must be in compliance with some of these new requirements, and we will begin enforcing those requirements on those specified dates. B. New Requirements for Making Public Hospital Standard Charges Under 45 CFR 180.50 In the CY 2020 HPT final rule, we finalized, at 45 CFR 180.50, specific requirements with which hospitals must comply for the purpose of making public a single comprehensive list of standard charges for the items and services they provide, including requirements that govern the format, data elements, location and access to the list, as well as the frequency by which they must update the list. In this section, for the reasons discussed below, we proposed to substantially modify \u00a7 180.50(a) through (d) of our regulations, which govern some of the requirements for how.Page 1377.hospitals must make public their standard charges for all items and services they provide. Specifically, we proposed to (1) define several new terms; (2) require hospitals to affirm the accuracy and completeness of the standard charges displayed in the MRF; (3) require hospitals to display additional data elements in their list of standard charges; (4) require display of standard charge information using a CMS template; and (5) adopt new requirements to improve automated access to the machine-readable file. 1. New Definitions We proposed to add the following definitions to \u00a7 180.20: \u2022 \u201cCMS template\u201d is a CSV format or JSON schema that CMS makes available for purposes of compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 180.40(a). \u2022 \u201cConsumer-friendly expected allowed amount\u201d is the average dollar amount that the hospital estimates it will be paid by a third party payer for an item or service. \u2022 \u201cEncode\u201d is entering data items into the fields of the CMS template. \u2022 \u201cMachine-readable file\u201d is a single digital file that is in a machine-readable format. We also proposed several technical and conforming revisions to ensure consistency of the use of these terms across the HPT regulations. Specifically, we proposed to replace references to \u201cthe file\u201d and \u201cthe digital file\u201d in \u00a7 180.50(d)(4) through (5) with the proposed defined term \u201cmachine-readable file.\u201d We also proposed to make revisions to references to the \u201cfile\u201d in the introductory text of \u00a7 180.50(c) and at \u00a7 180.50(e), which we addressed in the CY 2024 OPPS/ASC proposed rule as a part of other proposed changes. We received a few comments on our proposed definitions. Comment: One commenter recommended that the term \u201cconsumer-friendly expected allowed amount\u201d be modified to reflect an emphasis on using patient claims to calculate an average dollar amount, and to permit grouping at the service package level\n                "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The recent changes to pricing regulations focus on enhancing price transparency for hospitals.

Under the OPPS, we generally pay for hospital Part B services on a rate-per-service basis that varies according to the APC group to which the service is assigned. We use the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) (which includes certain Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes) to identify and group the services within each APC. The OPPS includes payment for most hospital outpatient services, except those identified in section I.C of this final rule with comment period. Section 1833(t)(1)(B) of the Act provides for payment under the OPPS for hospital outpatient services designated by the Secretary (which includes partial hospitalization services furnished by CMHCs), and certain inpatient hospital services that are paid under Medicare Part B..Page 32.The OPPS rate is an unadjusted national payment amount that includes the Medicare payment and the beneficiary copayment. This rate is divided into a labor-related amount and a nonlabor-related amount. The labor-related amount is adjusted for area wage differences using the hospital inpatient wage index value for the locality in which the hospital or CMHC is located. All services and items within an APC group are comparable clinically and with respect to resource use, as required by section 1833(t)(2)(B) of the Act. In accordance with section 1833(t)(2)(B) of the Act, subject to certain exceptions, items and services within an APC group cannot be considered comparable with respect to the use of resources if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary) for an item or service in the APC group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary) for an item or service within the same APC group (referred to as the \u201c2 times rule\u201d). In implementing this provision, we generally use the cost of the item or service assigned to an APC group. For new technology items and services, special payments under the OPPS may be made in one of two ways. Section 1833(t)(6) of the Act provides for temporary additional payments, which we refer to as \u201ctransitional pass-through payments,\u201d for at least 2 but not more than 3 years for certain drugs, biological agents, brachytherapy devices used for the treatment of cancer, and categories of other medical devices. For new technology services that are not eligible for transitional pass-through payments, and for which we lack sufficient clinical information and cost data to appropriately assign them to a clinical APC group, we have established special APC groups based on costs, which we refer to as New Technology APCs. These New Technology APCs are designated by cost bands which allow us to provide appropriate and consistent payment for designated new procedures that are not yet reflected in our claims data. Similar to pass-through payments, an assignment to a New Technology APC is temporary; that is, we retain a service within a New Technology APC until we acquire sufficient data to assign it to a clinically appropriate APC group..Page 33.C. Excluded OPPS Services and Hospitals Section 1833(t)(1)(B)(i) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to designate the hospital outpatient services that are paid under the OPPS. While most hospital outpatient services are payable under the OPPS, section 1833(t)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act excludes payment for ambulance, physical and occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services, for which payment is made under a fee schedule. It also excludes screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and effective January 1, 2011, an annual wellness visit providing personalized prevention plan services. The Secretary exercises the authority granted under the statute to also exclude from the OPPS certain services that are paid under fee schedules or other payment systems. Such excluded services include, for example, the professional services of physicians and nonphysician practitioners paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS); certain laboratory services paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS); services for beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that are paid under the ESRD prospective payment system; and services and procedures that require an inpatient stay that are paid under the hospital IPPS. In addition, section 1833(t)(1)(B)(v) of the Act does not include applicable items and services (as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (21)) that are furnished on or after January 1, 2017, by an off-campus outpatient department of a provider (as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (21)).

For additional information about our New Technology APC policy, we refer readers to through-payment-status-new-technology-ambulatory-payment-classification-apc and then follow the instructions to access the MEARISTM system for OPPS New Technology APC applications. In the CY 2004 OPPS final rule with comment period (68 FR 63416), we restructured the New Technology APCs to make the cost intervals more consistent across payment levels and refined the cost bands for these APCs to retain two parallel sets of New Technology APCs: one set with a status indicator of \u201cS\u201d (Significant Procedures, Not Discounted when Multiple. Paid under OPPS; separate APC payment) and the other set with a status indicator of \u201cT\u201d (Significant Procedure, Multiple Reduction Applies. Paid under OPPS; separate APC payment). These current New Technology APC configurations allow us to price new technology services more appropriately and consistently. For CY 2023, there were 52 New Technology APC levels, ranging from the lowest cost band assigned to APC 1491 (New Technology - Level 1A ($0-$10)) to the highest cost band assigned to APC 1908 (New Technology - Level 52 ($145,001-$160,000)). We note that the.Page 186.cost bands for the New Technology APCs, specifically, APCs 1491 through 1599 and 1901 through 1908, vary with increments ranging from $10 to $14,999. These cost bands identify the APCs to which new technology procedures and services with estimated service costs that fall within those cost bands are assigned under the OPPS. Payment for each APC is made at the mid-point of the APC\u2019s assigned cost band. For example, payment for New Technology APC 1507 (New Technology \u2013 Level 7 ($501 - $600)) is made at $550.50. Under the OPPS, one of our goals is to make payments that are appropriate for the services that are necessary for the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. The OPPS, like other Medicare payment systems, is budget neutral and increases are limited to the annual hospital market basket increase reduced by the productivity adjustment. We believe that our payment rates reflect the costs that are associated with providing care to Medicare beneficiaries and are adequate to ensure access to services (80 FR 70374). For many emerging technologies, there is a transitional period during which utilization may be low, often because providers are first learning about the technologies and their clinical utility. Quite often, parties request that Medicare make higher payments under the New Technology APCs for new procedures in that transitional phase. These requests, and their accompanying estimates for expected total patient utilization, often reflect very low rates of patient use of expensive equipment, resulting in high per-use costs for which requesters believe Medicare should make full payment. Medicare does not, and we believe should not, assume responsibility for more than its share of the costs of procedures based on projected utilization for Medicare beneficiaries and does not set its payment rates based on initial projections of low utilization for services that require expensive capital equipment. For the OPPS, we rely on hospitals to make informed business decisions regarding the acquisition of high-cost capital equipment, taking into consideration their knowledge about their entire patient base (Medicare beneficiaries included) and an understanding of Medicare\u2019s and other payers\u2019 payment policies. We refer readers to the CY 2013 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (77 FR 68314) for further discussion regarding this payment policy..Page 187.Some services assigned to New Technology APCs have very low annual volume, which we consider to be fewer than 100 claims (86 FR 63528). Where utilization of services assigned to a New Technology APC is low, it can lead to wide variation in payment rates from year to year, resulting in even lower utilization and potential barriers to access to new technologies, which ultimately limits our ability to assign the service to the appropriate clinical APC. To mitigate these issues, we finalized a policy, in the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, to utilize our equitable adjustment authority at section 1833(t)(2)(E) of the Act to adjust how we determine the costs for low-volume services assigned to New Technology APCs (83 FR 58892 and 58893). Specifically, in the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (83 FR 58893), we established that, in each of our annual rulemakings, we would calculate and present the result of each statistical methodology (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and median) based on up to 4 years of claims data and solicit public comment on which methodology should be used to establish the payment rate for the low-volume new technology service. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63529), we replaced the New Technology APC low volume policy with the universal low volume APC policy. Unlike the New Technology APC low volume policy, the universal low volume APC policy applies to clinical APCs and brachytherapy APCs, in addition to procedures assigned to New Technology APCs, and uses the highest of the geometric mean, arithmetic mean, or median based on up to 4 years of claims data to set the payment rate for the APC  In addition, placeholder code 3X008 has been replaced with CPT code 33276 (Insertion of phrenic nerve stimulator system (pulse generator and stimulating.Page 245.lead[s]), including vessel catheterization, all imaging guidance, and pulse generator initial analysis with diagnostic mode activation, when performed). Please refer to Table 43 below for the final OPPS New Technology APC and status indicator assignment for CPT code 33276 for CY 2024. The final CY 2024 payment rates can be found in Addendum B to this final rule via the Internet on the CMS website.

Cleerly Labs (APC 1511) Cleerly Labs is a Software as a Service (SaaS) that assesses the extent of coronary artery disease severity using Atherosclerosis Imaging-Quantitative Computer Tomography (AI-QCT). This procedure is performed to quantify the extent of coronary plaque and stenosis in patients who have undergone coronary computed tomography analysis (CCTA). The AMA CPT Editorial Panel established the following four codes associated with this service, effective January 1, 2021: 0623T: Automated quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque to assess severity of coronary disease, using data from coronary computed tomographic; angiography; data preparation and transmission, computerized analysis of data, with review of computerized analysis output to reconcile discordant data, interpretation and report..Page 246.0624T: Automated quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque to assess severity of coronary disease, using data from coronary computed tomographic angiography; data preparation and transmission. 0625T: Automated quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque to assess severity of coronary disease, using data from coronary computed tomographic angiography; computerized analysis of data from coronary computed tomographic angiography. 0626T: Automated quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque to assess severity of coronary disease, using data from coronary computed tomographic angiography; review of computerized analysis output to reconcile discordant data, interpretation and report. In the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we assigned the CPT codes 0623T, 06234T, 0625T, and 0626T to status indicator \u201cE1\u201d to indicate that the codes are not payable by Medicare when submitted on outpatient claims because the service had not received FDA clearance at the time of the assignment. For the October 2022 update, based on our review of the New Technology application submitted to CMS for OPPS payment consideration, we evaluated the current status indicator assignments for CPT codes 0623T-0626T. Based on the technology and its potential utilization in the HOPD setting, our evaluation of the service, as well as input from our medical advisors, we assigned CPT code 0625T to a separately payable status. Specifically, in the October 2022 OPPS Update CR (Change Request 12885, Transmittal 11594, dated September 9, 2022), we reassigned CPT code 0625T to status indicator \u201cS\u201d (Significant Procedures, Not Discounted when Multiple. Paid under OPPS; separate APC payment) and APC 1511 (New Technology - Level 11 ($900 - $1000)) with a payment rate of $950.50, effective October 1, 2022, following our review of the manufacturer\u2019s New Technology APC application. For CY 2024, the OPPS payment rates were proposed to be based on available CY 2022 claims data. There are 90 claims for CPT code 0625T during this time period. As this is below.Page 247.the threshold of 100 claims for a service within a year, we explained that we could propose to designate CPT code 0625T as a low volume service under our universal low volume APC policy and use the highest of the geometric mean cost, arithmetic mean cost, or median cost based on up to 4 years of claims data to assign code 0625T to the appropriate New Technology APC. We found the geometric mean cost for the service to be approximately $3.70, the arithmetic mean cost to be approximately $4.10, and the median cost to be approximately $3.50. Under our universal low volume APC policy, we would use the greatest of the statistical methodologies, the arithmetic mean, to assign CPT code 0625T to New Technology 1491 (New Technology Level 1A \u2013 (0-$10)) with a payment rate of $5.00  Response: We thank the commenter for their support for the APC assignment for CPT code 0808T and agree that the proposed APC assignment for CPT code 0808T accurately.Page 393.captures the costs associated with the service. Therefore, we are finalizing the APC assignment for CPT code 0808T as proposed. Comment: The manufacturer also commented on the proposed APC assignment for CPT code 0807T. The commenter stated that the proposed APC assignment for CPT code 0807T does not properly account for the costs associated with the required fluoroscopy imaging that is a part of the service. The commenter provided the CY 2024 proposed rule geometric mean costs for two fluoroscopy codes: CPT code 76000 (Fluoroscopy (separate procedure), up to 1 hour physician or other qualified health care professional time) with a proposed geometric mean cost of $262, and CPT code 76496 (Unlisted fluoroscopic procedure (eg, diagnostic, interventional) with a proposed geometric mean cost of $133, and explained that the proposed APC assignment for CPT code 0807T would not cover the costs of the fluoroscopy based on the proposed geometric mean costs of the two fluoroscopy codes. To account for the costs of the fluoroscopy that is performed as part of the service, the commenter requested that CMS assign CPT code 0807T to APC 5722 for CY 2024. Response: After further evaluation of CPT code 0807T, the resources required to perform the procedure, and input from our medical advisors, we believe it is appropriate to reassign CPT code 0807T to APC 5722. Based on our evaluation of the additional information provided to CMS as well as the claims data for existing fluoroscopy codes, we believe that the resource costs associated with CPT code 0807T are higher than those associated with the code\u2019s proposed APC assignment. Therefore, we are revising the APC assignment for CPT code 0807T for CY 2024. After consideration of the public comment, we are finalizing our proposal without modification to assign CPT code 0808T to APC 5722 for CY 2024. We are also finalizing the reassignment of CPT code 0807T to APC 5722 for CY 2024. The final CY 2024 payment rate for these codes can be found in Addendum B to this final rule with comment period. We also refer readers to Addendum D1 of this final rule with comment period for the SI meanings for all.Page 394.codes reported under the OPPS. Addenda B and D1 are available via the Internet on the CMS website. In addition, we note that CMS recognizes that software-based technologies are rapidly evolving, like the product used for HCPCS code C9786. In line with our comment solicitation on payment policy for software as a service (SaaS) procedures in the CY 2023 OPPS final rule (87 FR 72035 and 72036), CMS is considering, for future rulemaking, whether or not specific adjustments to payment policies and rate calculations are necessary in order to more accurately and appropriately pay for these products and services across settings of care. CMS remains open to feedback on these issues and welcomes engagement from interested parties, including from manufacturers, providers, and beneficiaries. 64. New Technology Applications Submitted to CMS Comment: We received comments regarding three pending New Technology APC applications, for the TriNav\uf0e4 Infusion System, Trabeculocanalicular Outflow Restoration, and Optilume Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) services. Response: We note that pending New Technology APC applications are reviewed via a sub-regulatory process, and therefore, application determinations are not made via rulemaking. As a result, we did not propose to create new codes for any of these services or assign them to New Technology APCs in the CY 2024 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. These New Technology APC applications are currently being reviewed and applicants will be notified of CMS\u2019s decision through our normal process. IV. OPPS Payment for Devices A.

New Technology Applications Submitted to CMS Comment: We received comments regarding three pending New Technology APC applications, for the TriNav\uf0e4 Infusion System, Trabeculocanalicular Outflow Restoration, and Optilume Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) services. Response: We note that pending New Technology APC applications are reviewed via a sub-regulatory process, and therefore, application determinations are not made via rulemaking. As a result, we did not propose to create new codes for any of these services or assign them to New Technology APCs in the CY 2024 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. These New Technology APC applications are currently being reviewed and applicants will be notified of CMS\u2019s decision through our normal process. IV. OPPS Payment for Devices A. Pass-Through Payment for Devices 1. Beginning Eligibility Date for Device Pass-Through Status and Quarterly Expiration of Device Pass-Through Payments a. Background The intent of transitional device pass-through payment, as implemented at \u00a7 419.66, is to facilitate access for beneficiaries to the advantages of new and truly innovative devices by.Page 395.allowing for adequate payment for these new devices while the necessary cost data is collected to incorporate the costs for these devices into the procedure APC rate (66 FR 55861). Under section 1833(t)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act, the period for which a device category eligible for transitional pass-through payments under the OPPS can be in effect is at least 2 years but not more than 3 years. Prior to CY 2017, our regulation at \u00a7 419.66(g) provided that this pass-through payment eligibility period began on the date CMS established a particular transitional pass-through category of devices, and we based the pass-through status expiration date for a device category on the date on which pass-through payment was effective for the category. In the CY 2017 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (81 FR 79654), in accordance with section 1833(t)(6)(B)(iii)(II) of the Act, we amended \u00a7 419.66(g) to provide that the pass-through eligibility period for a device category begins on the first date on which pass-through payment is made under the OPPS for any medical device described by such category. In addition, prior to CY 2017, our policy was to propose and finalize the dates for expiration of pass-through status for device categories as part of the OPPS annual update. This means that device pass-through status would expire at the end of a calendar year when at least 2 years of pass-through payments had been made, regardless of the quarter in which the device was approved. In the CY 2017 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (81 FR 79655), we changed our policy to allow for quarterly expiration of pass-through payment status for devices, beginning with pass-through devices approved in CY 2017 and subsequent calendar years, to afford a pass-through payment period that is as close to a full 3 years as possible for all pass-through payment devices. We also have an established policy to package the costs of the devices that are no longer eligible for pass-through payments into the costs of the procedures with which the devices are reported in the claims data used to set the payment rates (67 FR 66763)..Page 396.We refer readers to the CY 2017 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (81 FR 79648 through 79661) for a full discussion of the current device pass-through payment policy.14 In the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we finalized our policy to publicly post online OPPS device pass-through applications received on or after March 1, 2023, beginning with the issuance of the CY 2025 proposed rule and for each OPPS rulemaking thereafter. We refer readers to the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (87 FR 71934 through 71938) for a full discussion of the policy to publicly post OPPS device pass-through applications. b. Expiration of Transitional Pass-Through Payments for Certain Devices As stated earlier, section 1833(t)(6)(B)(iii) of the Act requires that, under the OPPS, a category of devices be eligible for transitional pass-through payments for at least 2 years, but not more than 3 years. Currently, there are 15 device categories eligible for pass-through payment. These devices are listed in Table 84 of this final rule with comment where we detail the expiration dates of pass-through payment status for each of the 15 devices currently receiving device pass-through payment g., myocardial viability); Myocardial imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), combined perfusion with metabolic evaluation study (including ventricular wall motion[s] 78433 and/or ejection fraction[s], when S 1521 S 1521 performed), dual radiotracer (e.g., myocardial viability); with concurrently acquired computed tomography transmission scan Comment: We received several comments disagreeing with the proposed payment rates for CPT codes 78431, 78432, and 78433. Several commenters stated that the proposed APC assignments for 2024 are not consistent with the resources needed to perform these services and requested that CMS assign all three CPT codes to New Technology APC 1523 (New Technology - Level 23 ($2501-$3000)). While commenters explained differences between each service, commenters still requested that all three codes be assigned to the same New Technology APC. Response: We thank the commenters for their input on our proposal. We do not agree that it would be appropriate to assign all three codes describing the services associated with cardiac PET/CT studies to the same New Technology APC. Since CPT codes 78431, 78432, and.Page 200.78433 first became effective on January 1, 2020, they have all been assigned to different New Technology APCs based on the perceived resource expenditures stemming from clinical differences in their code descriptors. Since first receiving claims data for these codes for the CY 2023 rulemaking cycle, there are differences between the codes in terms of claims data and claims frequency that serve as further evidence for the need for variations in New Technology APC assignments. Additionally, public comments regarding the clinical and resource differences between each code further underscore the need for different New Technology APC assignments. Therefore, we are not accepting commenters\u2019 suggestion to reverse course at this time and assign the three codes describing different services associated with cardiac PET/CT studies to the same New Technology APC. Comment: Some commenters urged that CMS maintain stable payment rates for three to five years to allow for appropriate adoption and implementation of the cardiac PET/CT services. Commenters explained that it takes time for hospitals to gain experience with new codes and for providers to become aware of how to appropriately bill new codes. Commenters pointed out that CPT codes 78431, 78432, and 78432 were made effective in 2020, which coincided with the COVID-19 public health emergency, and explained that there are still lingering effects of COVID-19 in terms of hospitals ordering and implementing new technology. Response: We note that we did not change the New Technology APC assignments for CPT codes 78431, 78432, and 78433 between CY 2020 through CY 2022. Therefore, CPT codes 78431, 78432, and 78433 had the exact same payment rate for three full calendar years. We believe that the time that has already been provided is sufficient for interested parties to educate providers on coding and for hospitals to appropriately report the services performed. Additionally, it is generally not our policy to judge the accuracy of provider coding and charging for purposes of ratesetting. We rely on hospitals and providers to accurately report the use of HCPCS codes in accordance with their code descriptors, and CPT and CMS instructions, and to.Page 201.report services accurately on claims and charges and costs for the services on their Medicare hospital cost report. Comment: Commenters strongly disagreed with the proposed APC reassignment for CPT code 78432 from APC 1520 to APC 1518 for CY 2024, and urged that CMS reassign CPT code 78432 to New Technology APC 1523, the New Technology APC to which it was first assigned in CY 2020 when there were no claims data yet available for the code. Commenters stated that they believed that six single frequency claims is not sufficient data to set payment rates for CPT code 78432. Other commenters explained that CPT code 78432 uses more resources than CPT code 78431 and requested that CMS consider collecting additional claims data in CY 2024 for CPT code 78432 before proposing to make an APC reassignment. Some commenters stated that they did not believe that it would benefit hospitals to adjust APC assignments year to year. These commenters stated that changes in APC assignments causes instability in payments and angst for hospitals. Response: We thank the commenters for their input, but note that section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires that the Secretary review not less often than annually and revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments to take into account, among other things, new cost data. For services assigned to New Technology APCs, as the OPPS acquires claims data regarding hospital costs associated with new procedures, we regularly examine the claims data and any available new information regarding the clinical aspects of new procedures to confirm that our OPPS payments remain appropriate for procedures as they transition into mainstream medical practice (77 FR 68314)\n                "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New Technology Payments under the OPPS include several key features:\n\n1. **Criteria for New Technology APCs**: For a service to be assigned to a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), it must:\n   - Be a truly new service, not reportable by existing HCPCS codes.\n   - Not be eligible for transitional pass-through payments.\n   - Fall within Medicare benefits and be deemed reasonable and necessary.\n\n2. **Cost Bands**: New Technology APCs have defined cost bands, with the payment for each APC made at the mid-point of the assigned cost band. For example, New Technology APC 1507 has a payment rate of $550.50 for costs ranging between $501 and $600.\n\n3. **Transitional Pass-Through Payments**: These are temporary additional payments for certain devices and services that allow higher reimbursement while complete cost data is gathered. This transitional status generally lasts between 2 and 3 years.\n\n4. **Low-Volume Services**: For services with low utilization (fewer than 100 claims), the payment rate can be determined using statistical methods (arithmetic mean, geometric mean, or median) based on available claims data.\n\n5. **Adjustments and Monitoring**: The CMS regularly reviews claims data to adjust New Technology APC assignments and payment rates, ensuring they reflect the costs associated with providing those services as they become more established in practice.\n\n6. **Feedback and Reassessment**: CMS welcomes feedback on the assignment of New Technology APCs and remains open to recommendations for policy adjustments, especially regarding new technologies and high-cost procedures.\n\nOverall, the New Technology Payments mechanism aims to support the introduction of innovative services while maintaining appropriate payment rates within the constraints of the Medicare budget."}]
